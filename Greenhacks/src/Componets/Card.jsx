            Trees For Air Pollution
          </h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
          Plant trees to protect the environment, it’s our only ray of light!   Air Pollution is the contamination of indoor or outdoor environments by an external agent, which turns out to be detrimental to the health of humans and other living organisms. One major benefit of reducing air pollution would be to substantially reduce the chances of diseases in humans, global warming, acid rain, ozone layer depletion and its effects on animals.
